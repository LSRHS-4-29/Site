  <h3>I do believe the components honesty, compassion, respect, responsibility, and courage are necessary for a good citizenship. Honesty means being straightforward and fair.
     Without honesty the whole world would be full of lies and that leads to problems. Compassion means sympathy compassion and concern for others.
      We need compassion because that's how we look out for others and love people. Respect means a feeling of deep admiration for someone.
      Respect is needed for a good citizen because
     that's how you gain others to like you and have less enemies. Responsibility means having the duty to deal with something.
      Citizens need good responsibility because it gives them purpose through life, for example looking out for your younger brother or doing all your homework.
       Courage means doing something that would frighten one. Courage is also necessary because that is how we discover new things and discover more about yourself.
       Another component that I feel is necessary is trust. Trust means a firm belief or ability in someone or something.
       I feel as if trust is a necessary component for a citizen because if you can't trust someone or something then it must be a pretty hard way to live your life and enjoy it.
        One act of citizenship that I witnessed was respect.
       I was watching Television and Miguel Cabrera, a great hitter had struck out on a slider by Corey Kluber.
       Right after Miguel struck out he gave a nod and thumbs up to Corey, basically showing that he had earned Coreys respect as a pitcher.<h3>
