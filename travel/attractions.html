    <h2>There are so many things to do while you are enjoying yourself in the
      Bahamas. One thing to do is go to the beach. The beaches in the Bahamas are
      very pretty with the clear warm water and great weather. You can also go scuba
      diving all over the island. Ive just named a couple of the great things you can do
      on this island.
